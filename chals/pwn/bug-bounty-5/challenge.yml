flags:

hints:
  - Stack addresses may be randomized, but their relative positions are not (i.e. two variables on the stack will always be a fixed distance apart).
  - Can you leak a stack address somehow, and use it to calculate the address of an array on the stack?
  - This uses a [format string vulnerability](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/binary-exploitation/format-strings). Read the pwn guides!
