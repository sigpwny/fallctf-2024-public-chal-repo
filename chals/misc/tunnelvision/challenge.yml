hints:
  - You see the tunnel widen, as something enters the light. It starts with `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`, and it seems to carry some cookies. Maybe you should **follow** it?
  - Maybe you don't understand the secrets of the [tunnel](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-dns-tunneling)?
