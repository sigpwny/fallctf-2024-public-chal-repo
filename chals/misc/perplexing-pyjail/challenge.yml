hints:
  - Understanding co_names is vital to solving this challenge.
  - co_names is a list that stores the names of global/local variables and attributes that are referenced in the python code.
  - co_names does not store constants, such as strings ('hello world') and numbers (2).
  - Every item in co_names is unique, if a name appears twice (or more) in a piece of code, it is only added to co_names the first time it appears.
  - For example, the code `print('hello world'); foo.bar(2); print('done')` produces the co_names `("print", "foo", "bar")`.
