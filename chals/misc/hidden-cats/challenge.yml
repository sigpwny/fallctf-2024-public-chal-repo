  Several kittens have messed with a broken png and have hidden a flag in it. 
  The file provided has something called [Magic Numbers](https://gist.github.com/leommoore/f9e57ba2aa4bf197ebc5), use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to fix the image and find the flag.

hints:
  - Look at the *name* (not file type) of the document provided, it might give you a hint on what the current format is!
  - The flag is not in the metadata of the image, it is in the image itself
  - You only need to fix the first 4 hexes of the image to see the flag
  - Are you sure you rendered the image once you fixed the hex? There is a render function in CyberChef!
