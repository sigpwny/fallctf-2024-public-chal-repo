  Hi there Bob! Let's say you wanted to send a handshake to Alice. You choose a curve
  `y^2 = (x^3 + ax + b) mod p` and generator point `G(G_x, G_y)`. 
  
  Now Alice was going to send you her public point Q_a, but it seems that the transmission glitched, and 
  you only got her x coordinate, `Q_a_x`. Can you still get your shared secret?

  **Note**: The actual shared secret for the decryptor would be the SHA-256 hash of the x coordinate of the shared secret.
  So that would be `sha256(S_x)`

  **Note**: There is two shared secrets you can arrive at, only one of them will work.
