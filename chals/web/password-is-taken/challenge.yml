  I wonder what it's like to be an *admin* of a popular page.
  It must suck to have everyone try and steal your *password*.

  **DO NOT ENTER ANY OF YOUR REAL PASSWORDS INTO THE SITE**

  https://password-is-taken.chal.fallctf.com

  ```
  import requests

  remote = "https://password-is-taken.chal.fallctf.com"

  response = requests.get(remote)
  print(response.text)
  ```
