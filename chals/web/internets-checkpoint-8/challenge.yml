  I've stumbled upon the internet's checkpoint, and it's telling me that if I take a break it will reward me with a flag. However, I have the attention span of a goldfish and want to get back to watching my skibidi rizz brainrot videos on TikTok.

  Can you dig around on the website's source code to find a way to get me the final flag before my patience runs out, while also discovering the other flags along the way?

  **Tip**: All of the flags are prefixed with the corresponding challenge number (e.g., `fallctf{1_flag}`)

  Check out our [Web Hacking I](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/general/2024-09-12/) meeting for some useful info!

hints:
  - Please don't actually refresh the webpage 10,000 times. This is common sense.
  - How do web browsers keep track of user data across page refreshes and reconnects?
  - My favorite ones are chocolate chip
  - Check under the Application header of the developer tool menu (expand the menu options with the >> button)
