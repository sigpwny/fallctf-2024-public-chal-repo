  SUPERMEGACORP has launched yet another incredible product, B2B SSRF as a service.
  The marketing team still doesn't really understand why it was called that, but they ran out of money to pay any developers, so they can't complain about it to them.
  We used our unpaid senior dev to rework SSRFaaS to target this untapped market and push it directly to prod.
