hints:
  - Try viewing a cat image in a new tab and changing the image name to a random cat image file that doesn't exist (like cat11.jpg).
  - What does a double dot (..) in a path mean (Google!)? Could we use this to our advantage since we know the flag image is located in the root folder?
  - The website provides a clear picture of what the relevant file paths are!
  - This is called a path traversal vulnerability.
