name: "Enron Feedback 2"

description: |-
  Enron's accounting department is very interested in the public's feedback (not really.) When you submit your feedback an admin will dutifully review your feedback.

  The admin has a bit of special "accounting" info on their page. Can you find a way to get it?

  **Tip**: All of the flags are prefixed with the corresponding challenge number (e.g., `fallctf{2_flag}`)

  Check out our [Web Hacking II](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/general/2024-09-15/) meeting for some useful info!

  **Update**: Added a new hint

hints:
  - Try using [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to setup a webserver to exfiltrate data
  - Try to send the contents of the webpage to your webhook.
  - Be careful that the page loads before we send off the body
  - Make sure to add CORS headers so the admin's browser can call your endpoint. See [XSS guide](https://fallctf.com/guide-2024/web/web#cross-site-scripting-xss) for more details.
