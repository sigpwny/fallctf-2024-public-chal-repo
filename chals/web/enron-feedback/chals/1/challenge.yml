  Enron's accounting department is very interested in the public's feedback (not really.) When you submit your feedback an admin will dutifully review your feedback.

  I think if you confuse the admin by sending an `alert`, they might be convinced into embezzling some money for you.

  **Tip**: All of the flags are prefixed with the corresponding challenge number (e.g., `fallctf{1_flag}`)

  Check out our [Web Hacking II](https://sigpwny.com/meetings/general/2024-09-15/) meeting for some useful info!
