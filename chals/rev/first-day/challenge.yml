  You switched jobs to a sub-sub-sub-contractor for SUPERMEGACORP.
  Your first task is to download and install Ghidra. Unfortunately, your mentor works on a seperate floor and doesn't bother helping the newbies.

  Once installed, go to Help > User Agreement. Find the 3 words after "Ghidra is designed to facilitate".

  Input the flag as "fallctf{word1_word2_word3}". E.g. "I love SaaS" would become fallctf{i_love_saas} (all lowercase).
