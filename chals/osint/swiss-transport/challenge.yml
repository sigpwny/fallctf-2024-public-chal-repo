  I forgot the name to my favorite swiss train station :(

  All I remember are these highly specific facts about it (lucky you!):

  - it was located in the city of ZÃ¼rich
  - it was within 500 meters of a mountain peak
  - the train station is at an elevation of more than 750 meters.

  If only there was [a tool](https://overpass-turbo.eu) that could query for stuff like this...

  Provide the name of the station wrapped in the flag format, all lowercase, with spaces replaced with underscores.

  For example, fallctf{times_square}
