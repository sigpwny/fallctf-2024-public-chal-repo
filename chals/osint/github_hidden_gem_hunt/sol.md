**Solution**

1. Get Username from User ID: Use the GitHub API to fetch user information from the user ID 583231 by calling https://api.github.com/user/583231, which will return the username (octocat).

2. List Repositories: Once you have the username, use another GitHub API call to list the repositories of this user by calling https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos.

3. Find Hidden Repository: Look for the repository with over 5000 stars (there is only one), check its creation date, and use its name and creation date to form the flag in the format fallctf{repository_name-creation_date}.
