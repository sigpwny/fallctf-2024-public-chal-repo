  I am inspired to get into photography now!
  I found some pictures online that were all taken at different National Parks, but I don't know which ones.
  I want to visit all of these National Parks so I can practice taking photos in them - can you help me identify the names of them? 

  Note: This challenge does not rely on the completion of the Photography I or Photography II challenges.
