**Solution**

Photo #1: Search through pictures of different national parks and match the landscape with Glacier National Park.
Photo #2: Search up pictures of National Parks with mountains/wildflowers - you should realize that the mountain's shape matches that of Mount Rainier.
Photo #3: A distinguishing feature about this photo is the presence of moss. Searching "national parks with moss" should quickly yield Olympic National Park.
Photo #4: Look closely at the curvature of the cliff - it matches that of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park.
Photo #5: The presence of the boardwalk/thermal pools indicates Yellowstone National Park.
