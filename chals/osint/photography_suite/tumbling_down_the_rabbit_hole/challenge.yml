  Thanks for helping me figure out who the photographer of that awesome picture is! 
  I wonder what kind of camera they use and how long they have been using it? 
  Maybe they have information about that somewhere online...

  Note: 'Photography I: Anonymous???' should be completed prior to attempting this challenge.
