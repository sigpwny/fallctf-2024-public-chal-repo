**Solution**

1. Use an OSINT tool like Sherlock to find the GitHub profile corresponding to the photographer's real name, siggepohneigh (determined from the first part). They should navigate to the README.md file to obtain a link to the photographer's Tumblr profile.

    ```sherlock siggepohneigh```

2. Images are not always displayed on the main page of a Tumblr profile, so the user should navigate to the /archive page of the profile to see all photos ever posted. The trick is that https://siggepohneigh.tumblr.com/ redirects to https://siggepohneigh.tumblr.com/tagged/main, so the user must change the url to https://siggepohneigh.tumblr.com/archive.

3. Once the user is able to see all posts, they should find the post with a camera pictured in it and determine that it is a FujiFilm X100 camera (based on contexual clues in the photo) and the year it was purchased (mentioned in the post's description).
