# Dark and Foggy

## Guidance for admin/helpers giving hints

There are two parts to the flag: the street name and the secret message
- Street Name
  - The target street is the street I'm facing (so the one without the red car).
  - The low visibility makes identifying the street pretty difficult, but identifying the building on the right would be helpful. (The sign on the middle right is barely legible, but I think you can parse out a “Krannert” from it)
- Secret Message
  - The hint on the challenge addresses this part; if people don't know how to extract image metadata, tell them to try other challenges or read the OSINT guide. 

## Solution

I took this picture from the front entrance of ISR, so the streets in the picture are S Gregory St (street I’m facing) and W Illinois St (street with the red car). The street for the flag is S Gregory St, and the secret message can be found by looking at the image metadata.
