  Parks are nice and quiet in Japan. Well, except for this one in which you will be bothered by a bunch of jerks.
  
  To make this challenge not trivial though, you not only need to find the park, but also need to find the *place of interest* directly *south* of where I took this photo.
  
  In this photo, I am facing *south-west*, and this road is pointing *west*.
  
  *Place of interest* is the purple or green icons you can click on, on Google Maps.

  flag format: fallctf{name of the place from Google Maps in English, Park name}
  
  example: fallctf{Sannomaru Shozokan, Imperial Palace East National Gardens}
  
  If you go to Imperial Palace East National Gardens, it shows up as a park in Google Maps, but you can also find Sannomaru Shozokan being a icon you can click within this garden.
