  Even intersections in Japan look nice. Can you find where I was standing when I took this photo?
  
  To avoid confusion about road names, there is a white label directly on top of the location with Google Maps. These white labels can be seen directly on top of large intersections.

  flag format: fallctf{name of the intersection from Google Maps in English, city}
  
  example: fallctf{Nishinippori 5, Tokyo}
  
  If you go to Nishinippori 5 on Google Maps, click "close" and zoom out a little bit, you should be able to see the label.
